# Arduino-roadmap
In this roadmap to arduino you will find all resources and links needed to get started with Arduino. You are welcome to come to the club and work on Arduino projects on your own, and our hardware team members will provide you with any help needed (arduino,breadboard,sensors,motorsâ€¦). Our doors are always open to enthusiasts like you!

# What is the Arduino
Arduino is an open-source electronics platform based on easy-to-use hardware and software. Arduino boards are able to read inputs - light on a sensor, a finger on a button, or a Twitter message - and turn it into an output - activating a motor, turning on an LED, publishing something online. You can tell your board what to do by sending a set of instructions to the microcontroller on the board. To do so you use the Arduino programming language (C or C++) and Arduino IDE Software.

# The Roadmap

[Blinking LED](https://github.com/medAzizLHB/Arduino-Roadmap/tree/main/00-Blinking%20LED) : Hello world! code of Arduino.

[Push button](https://github.com/medAzizLHB/Arduino-Roadmap/tree/main/01-Push%20button) : Read data from the push button.

[IR sensor](https://github.com/medAzizLHB/Arduino-Roadmap/tree/main/02-IR%20sensor) : IR sensor interface.

[Potentiometer](https://github.com/medAzizLHB/Arduino-Roadmap/tree/main/03-Potentiometer) : Read analog data.

[Buzzer](https://github.com/medAzizLHB/Arduino-Roadmap/tree/main/04-Buzzer) : Make some noise.

[Gas sensor](https://github.com/medAzizLHB/Arduino-Roadmap/tree/main/05-gas%20sensor) : Detect gas in the air.

[Ultrasonic](https://github.com/medAzizLHB/Arduino-Roadmap/tree/main/06-ultrasonic) : Measure distance between sensor and an object

[Servo Motor](https://github.com/medAzizLHB/Arduino-Roadmap/tree/main/07-servo) : A motor that can accurately rotate from 0 to 180 degrees.

[DC Motor](https://github.com/medAzizLHB/Arduino-Roadmap/tree/main/08-DC%20motor) : Control a motor in bidirection.

[Stepper Motor](https://github.com/medAzizLHB/Arduino-Roadmap/tree/main/09-Stepper%20motor) : A motor that rotates in a series of small angular steps.

[LCD](https://github.com/medAzizLHB/Arduino-Roadmap/tree/main/10-I2C%20lcd) : Display a text on screen


# Your first project: 


Gas leaks can go undetected and cause death. We can solve this by building a gas level detecting system using Gas sensor and a buzzer.

   1.  Display the gas percentage on the LCD Display

  2. Detect dangerous levels of gas concentration using if-conditions.

  3.  Make an alarm using a buzzer and LEDs.
