# Arduino-roadmap
In this roadmap to arduino you will find all resources and links needed to get started with Arduino. You are welcome to come to the club and work on Arduino projects on your own, and our hardware team members will provide you with any help needed (arduino,breadboard,sensors,motorsâ€¦). Our doors are always open to enthusiasts like you!

# What is the Arduino
Arduino is an open-source electronics platform based on easy-to-use hardware and software. Arduino boards are able to read inputs - light on a sensor, a finger on a button, or a Twitter message - and turn it into an output - activating a motor, turning on an LED, publishing something online. You can tell your board what to do by sending a set of instructions to the microcontroller on the board. To do so you use the Arduino programming language (C or C++) and Arduino IDE Software.

# The Roadmap
